### **How'd I get here?**

Whacked! was one of two video games originally distributed to beta-testers of Microsoft's Xbox Live online multiplayer gaming service (the domain owner being one of them). Developed by [Presto Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_Studios) and published by [Microsoft Game Studios](https://microsoftstudios.com), the game was ultimately released in late-2002 to mixed reviews. Gameplay centered around characters participating in a hilariously bizzare game show. As players progressed, various commercials were unlocked (the one for Yolk-O-Matic among them). This crummy placeholder site is an extremely poor, albeit fond homage to the creative genius behind the concepts and art that went into the game.
