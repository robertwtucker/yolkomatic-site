# How'd I get here?

<h4>Whacked! was one of two video games originally distributed to beta-testers of Microsoft's
Xbox Live online multiplayer gaming service (the domain owner being one of them). Developed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_Studios">Presto Studios</a> and published by
<a href="https://microsoftstudios.com">Microsoft Game Studios</a>, the game was ultimately
released in late-2002 to mixed reviews. Gameplay centered around characters participating
in a hilariously bizzare game show. As players progressed, various commercials were unlocked
(the one for Yolk-O-Matic among them). This crummy placeholder site is an extremely poor,
albeit fond homage to the creative genius behind the concepts and art that went into the game.</h4>
